I've been collecting laptop stickers for a while, but only started affixing them to my laptop last year.  I didn't want to lose them when my work laptop was returned or replaced.  My solution was to buy a hard shell case, which I can remove and keep.

I recently got back from speaking at AWS re:Inforce 2023, where I acquired some new stickers.  I took a picture to share and highlight some of my favorite laptop stickers.

I will admit there are a lot of AWS related stickers, but I do work for AWS as a Sr. Solutions Architect.

Some of my favorites:

- [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/) (top right) which I got from creator Bj√∂rn Kimminich when he came to MN and spoke at a user group.
- [Request Metrics](https://requestmetrics.com/) sloth (bottom center) saying "Yo Dawg, I heard you like JS" which Todd Gardner had custom made.  The perfect combination of branding and a reference to a classic meme.
- Cedar policy (center) as an example of next level Rickrolling.  Read my earlier [Song lyrics represented using Cedar policy language](../2023-05-16-song-lyrics-represented-using-cedar-policy-language) blog post for more details. 
- The MSP 12 gray duck (top left) because I'm from Minnesota and play [Duck, Duck, Gray Duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck,_duck,_goose#Duck,_Duck,_Gray_Duck) instead of Duck, duck, goose.
