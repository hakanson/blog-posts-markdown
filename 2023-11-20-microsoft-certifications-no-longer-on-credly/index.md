Even while working for AWS as a Solutions Architect, I keep my Microsoft Azure certifications up to date.  These free renewals happen every year on the Microsoft Learn platform.  


|Certification title | Certification number | Earned on | Expires on |
|--|--|--|--|
|Microsoft Certified: Azure Security Engineer Associate | D5CB4B-49F723 | Jan 21, 2021 | Jan 21, 2024 |
|Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate | 9P7D3F-0425CF | Mar 13, 2021 | Mar 13, 2024 |
|Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert | 13RB68-44EC4D | Oct 30, 2020 | Oct 30, 2024 |

My most recent renewal on October 21 for Azure Solutions Architect Expert renewal was missing / shows expired on Credly.  I reached out for support and got this reply:

> Microsoft Certifications earned and claimed on Credly before June 30, 2023, will be available for viewing and sharing through Credly until June 30, 2024. However, **your Microsoft Certifications on Credly will no longer be kept current or updated as you pass renewal exams or earn new Microsoft Certifications.** This is because Microsoft is not partnered with Credly anymore.

I'm a bit sad, because I liked having all my [digital badges](https://www.credly.com/users/kevin-hakanson/badges) in one place.  I guess the obvious focus for me is collecting more [AWS Learning Badges](https://aws.amazon.com/training/badges/) then running my [credly-badges-to-csv](https://github.com/hakanson/credly-badges-to-csv) utility to show off.
