I wanted to get this Microsoft [Azure Security Engineer Associate](https://www.youracclaim.com/earner/earned/badge/90d25898-59a8-46d6-a287-059fa413f201) certification to pair with my [AWS Certified Security â€“ Specialty](https://www.youracclaim.com/earner/earned/badge/53e9cb80-565c-403a-80ca-35658329d8a0) accomplishment, but I kept seeing how hard it was to pass the exam. I want to give credit a couple of my LinkedIn connections for giving me the extra push I needed.
* [Chris Hughes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-h-97680442/) for sharing his journey that involved not passing the first time thus removing the stigma of not being perfect.
* [Pete Zerger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petezerger/) for both his [Become an Azure Security Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-an-azure-security-engineer) LinkedIn learning courses and the free [How to pass the Microsoft AZ-500 Exam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkP6NZ83U5c) YouTube content he publishes.

Neither of these people knows who I am, but both helped me achieve my goal. Thank you.
