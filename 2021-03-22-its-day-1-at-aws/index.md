Today I start at AWS as a Sr. Solutions Architect at AWS.  It is "Day 1" for me both in the English definition of the phrase as well as using the Amazon vernacular.  

> "Day 1 is both a culture and an operating model that puts the customer at the center of everything Amazon does."

There is a lot more to the [Elements of Amazonâ€™s Day 1 Culture](https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/how-amazon-defines-and-operationalizes-a-day-1-culture/) than just this pull quote.  I recommend reading about Day 1 vs Day 2 mentalities.

I'm excited to start, and anticipate I will be quite busy for a while.
