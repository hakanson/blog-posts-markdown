Today (December 1, 2020) is the day Amazon Alexa is [deprecating the Echo Buttons Skill API](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/ask-overviews/deprecated-features.html#deprecated-echo-button-skills). In 2018, I published a couple Alexa skills for Echo Buttons ([Color Stumper](https://www.amazon.com/KJH-Software-LLC-Color-Stumper/dp/B07K1FNR31); [Rochambeau Buttons](https://www.amazon.com/KJH-Software-LLC-Rochambeau-Buttons/dp/B07JJ216XZ/)) and even have two unopened sets of buttons which I won as prizes.

Receiving free Amazon Echo devices started when I attended AWS re:Invent 2016 with both the Echo Dot swag gift and winning a "full size" Echo as a finalist in that year's AWS re:Invent Alexa Skill Contest with [My First Published Alexa Skill: Mars Rover Mission](/2016-12-21-my-first-published-alexa-skill-mars-rover-mission).

That didn't give me fame and fortune, but the hands-on coding and skill publishing did provide me the knowledge to achieve the [AWS Certified Alexa Skill Builder - Specialty](https://www.youracclaim.com/earner/earned/badge/18716c6f-2343-45c6-89a5-3d2cbbc7ef50) last week.

However, it was recently announced that cert is being retired in March 2021.

> Please note that we will be retiring the AWS Certified Alexa Skill Builder - Specialty exam (AXS-C01) and the corresponding practice exam (AXS-P01) on March 23, 2021. The last day to take the exam will be March 22, 2021.

AWS re:Invent 2020 starts today, and I'm off to learn something new.
